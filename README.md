### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan Leifer, a passionate and driven individual with a knack for solving complex problems and making a meaningful impact in the tech world. From my days as a competitive ski racer, where finding the most efficient racing line was essential, to improving supply chain efficiency, creating data pipelines, building tax tools, helping my fraternity optimize its expenses and its alumni network, I always attack problems head on. 

I am known for my strong work ethic, a trait rooted in my genuine love for the work I do and the exhilarating challenges it presents. My journey is a testament to my relentless pursuit of excellence and my thirst for making a positive impact in every endeavor I undertake.
